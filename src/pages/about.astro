        <h2>👋 Hey there, Nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>
          🌿 I'm a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> based in Helsinki, dedicated
          to crafting seamless user experiences by bridging the worlds of design
          and code. My current favorite technologies include NextJS, Tailwind & MongoDB
        </p>
        <p>
          🌟 My journey into coding started as early as childhood, as I sought
          innovative solutions to solve my day-to-day challenges by automating
          tasks on my trusty computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          🎶 Prior to making coding my full-time endeavor, my journey began with
          a deep passion for music that led me to completing a Bachelor's Degree
          in music. At the time I applied for college, this decision was quite
          audacious given I had no prior experience in music, and auditions were
          looming just three months away. Fueled by relentless determination, I
          dedicated myself to intense study which earned me admission into
          college.
        </p>
        <p>
          👨‍💻 Fast forward, I embarked on a tech adventure, studying <strong
            >Computer Science at the University of Laval</strong
          > in Quebec City, diving into the depths of OOP, Relational Modeling, and
          even testing my skills in Assembly (ARM).
        </p>
        <p>
          💼 Over the years, I've freelanced on various music projects, but my
          tech obsession slowly took over my work. I handled everything: from
          designing my brand identity, to orchestrating successful Facebook ad
          campaigns. My skillset expanded to include programming and web
          development as I designed, developed and managed my artist website and
          e-commerce store.
        </p>
        <p>
          🚀 Recently, I decided to pivot back to programming full-time. I
          completed part 1-7 of the <strong>
            Full-stack Open Course with the University of Helsinki
          </strong>, reaffirming my passion for web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          💡 I'm on the lookout for projects that will push my technical and
          creative boundaries. I'd love to join a team of passionate developers
          for which my unique set skills and experience can be an asset, and
          from which I can learn new skills!
