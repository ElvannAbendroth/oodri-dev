    <h2>👋 Hey there, Nice to meet you!</h2>
    <p>
      🌿 I'm a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> based in Helsinki, dedicated
      to crafting seamless user experiences by bridging the worlds of design and
      code. My current favorite technologies include NextJS, Tailwind & MongoDB
    </p>
    <p>
      🌟 My journey into coding started as early as childhood, as I sought
      innovative solutions to solve my day-to-day challenges with the help of my
      trusty family computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      🎶 Prior to making coding my full-time endeavor, my journey began with a
      deep passion for music that led me to completing a Bachelor's Degree in
      music. At the time I applied for college, this decision was quite
      audacious given I had no prior experience in music, and auditions were
      looming just three months away. Fueled by relentless determination, I
      dedicated myself to intense study which earned me not only admission into
      college, but also a spot in the advanced music theory class.
    </p>
    <p>
      👨‍💻 Fast forward, I embarked on a tech adventure, studying <strong
        >Computer Science at the University of Laval</strong
      > in Quebec City, diving into the depths of <strong>
        OOP, Relational Modeling,</strong
      > and even testing my skills in <strong> Assembly (ARM)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      💼 Over the years, I've freelanced on various music projects, but my tech
      obsession slowly took over my work. I handled everything: from desinging
      up my<strong> artist website</strong> and setting up <strong>
        e-commerce and email integrations
      </strong>, all the way to coding my own<strong> Discord bot</strong>. My
      skillset also expanded to include v<strong>
        isual design, brand identity, copyrighting
      </strong> and running successful lead generation campaigns with the
      <strong>Facebook Ads</strong> platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      🚀 Recently, I decided to pivot back to programming full-time. I completed
      part 1-7 of the <strong>
        Full-stack Open Course with the University of Helsinki
      </strong>, reaffirming my passion for web technologies and earning the
      course certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      💡 I'm on the lookout for projects that will push my technical and
      creative boundaries. I'd love to join a team of passionate developers for
      which my unique set skills and experience can be an asset, and from which
      I can learn new skills!
