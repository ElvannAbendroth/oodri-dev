      <h2 class="font-medium text-2xl text-gray-800">About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack developer based in Helsinki looking to join a team of
        developers. Over 10 years of running my own businesses, I have sharpened
        project management and client relationship skills. I've been developing
        customized web solutions to handle marketing, user accounts, and systems
        management.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently going through the full-stack developement course offered
        by the University of Helsinki, which is endorsed by known companies
        including Houston, Unity & Terveystalo. I have completed the base
        certificate as well as the Typescript & GraphQL certificates.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I love most in developement is bridging the gap between feature
        implementation and elegant front-end user experiences with the help of
        my technical skills, design & marketing experience. Lately, NextJS has
        been at the center of my interests; it has facilitated the integration
        of back-end logic with the front-end, data management and scalable
        deployement with Gihub & Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe having a cooperation-driven mindset and good communication are
        crutial for a team's success, hence I'm often finding myself naturally
        stepping into a mediator role. I'm also a person with an intiatiable
        drive to improve my knowledge and technical skills. I thrive in
        environnements that promote independence and creative problem solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me playing music, singing, doing
        digital illustrations and playing video games.
