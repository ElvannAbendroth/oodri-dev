## 👋 Hey there, Nice to meet you!

🌿 I'm a **full-stack web developer** based in Helsinki, dedicated to crafting seamless user experiences by bridging the worlds of design and code. My current favorite technologies include NextJS, Tailwind & MongoDB

🌟 My journey into coding started as early as childhood, as I sought innovative solutions to solve my day-to-day challenges by automating tasks on my trusty computer.

🎶 Prior to making coding my full-time endeavor, my journey began with a deep passion for music that led me to completing a **Bachelor's Degree in music**. At the time I applied for college, this decision was quite audacious given I had no prior experience in music, and auditions were looming just three months away. Fueled by relentless determination, I dedicated myself to intense study which earned me admission into college.

👨‍💻 Fast forward, I embarked on a tech adventure, studying **Computer Science at the University of Laval** in Quebec City, diving into the depths of OOP, Relational Modeling, and even testing my skills in Assembly (ARM).

💼 Over the years, I've freelanced on various music projects, but my tech obsession slowly took over my work. I handled everything: from designing my brand identity to orchestrating successful Facebook ad campaigns. My skillset expanded to include programming and web development as I took on the design of my artist website and e-commerce store.

🚀 Recently, I decided to pivot back to programming full-time. I completed part 1-7 of the Full-stack Open Course with the University of Helsinki, reaffirming my passion for web technologies.

💡 I'm on the lookout for projects that will push my technical and creative boundaries. I'd love to join a team of passionate developers for which my unique set skills and experience can be an asset, and from which I can learn new skills!

Let's chat! 🚀
