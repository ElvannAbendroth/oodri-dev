At the turn of 2024, I'm happy to be joining [MovEd](https://www.moved.fi/) to help them with their website needs!  

I first found out about the organization during my first "She got This" meeting with my mentor [Hannele Mennala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannelemennala/), which turned out to be in need of a web developer for managing and updating the content on their marketing website since theirs had just left.  She kindly asked me to consider joining the team, besides it being an excellent opportunity to meet new people in my industry in Finland.

## Role & Responsibilities

At this moment, I am tasked with developing new features, updating and maintaining their marketing website, as well as actively contribute to the UI/UX design needs of the business.  The previous designer did a fantastic job as establishing a strong branding for the company, and I'm excited to pick up where they left to improve the web experience further.

In the past couple of weeks, I have collaborated with the designated UX designer to come up with a structure for the website that would improve the user experience, notably make it easier for users to find the content and information that they need.  The application process for the **MovEd by Mentoring** program campaign is coming to an end and the end of January, and so the focus has been on making sure the application forms and information about the program were easy to find on the website.
