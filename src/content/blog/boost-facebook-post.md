> This article was written as a guide to help my band with choosing the right posts to boost

## Step 1: How to Define Your Objective

Understanding what is the goal of the ad is absolutely CRUCIAL to get good results for a low cost on Facebook.

There are usually 2 different types of objectives that will require a very different setup:

### TYPE #1: Reach & Growth

Reach new people & grow our audience.  These types of ads should pass as normal posts and should look as little “salesy” as possible.  It must stay native (no external link)

This is the first time someone will hear about the product, so it’s important to keep it really engaging.

Showing some video or boosting a post that has good organic traffic is a great way to drive good results!  Video ads are super powerful, because it’s easy to target people who watched them (by % of watched time) with ads after that.  We made and keeping it native to the platform.

### TYPE #2:  Conversions

Show new material to existing fan base & reach out to.  This must feel as native as possible, but since the targeted people have already heard about our music, product or service by this point, it’s cheaper to have them click external links or ask them to perform more complex actions (conversions).

Conversions include things like signing up to an email list or sales, or any action that goes beyond the “I heard about this band, they are kind of cool” to someone who is ready to “commit” a bit deeper to what we have to offer.
