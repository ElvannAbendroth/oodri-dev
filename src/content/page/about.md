title: "About"
---

I am a full-stack developer based in Helsinki looking to join a team of developers. Over 10 years of running my own businesses, I have sharpened project management and client relationship skills. I've been developing customized web solutions to handle marketing, user accounts, and systems management.

What I love most in development is **bridging the gap between feature implementation and user experience**. Some of the top technologies I've been loving working with lately are NextJS (React), Typescript, Tailwind & MongoDB.  NextJS is at the top of the list, as it facilitated the integration of back-end logic with the front-end, data management and scalable deployment with Github & Vercel.
 

### Personality

People describe me as driven, creative and adaptable.  In group situations, I often find myself stepping into a mediator role.  I believe cooperation and good communication are the heart of success for team projects.

<!-- I believe cooperation and communication are the heart of a successful team, hence I'm often finding myself naturally stepping into a mediator role. I'm also a person with an insatiable drive to improve my knowledge and technical skills. I thrive in environments that promote independence and creative problem solving. -->

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing music, drawing, and playing video games.
