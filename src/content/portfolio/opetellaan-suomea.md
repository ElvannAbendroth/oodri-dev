## About this Project

**Opetellaan Suomea** is a language learning app to help Finnish learners with declinaisons & conjugaisons.

When I started to learn Finnish and moved to Finland, I initially found the language very difficult.  In order to help me study, I created a simple app with one goal: practicing Finnish verb conjugaisons. I've now decided to rewrite this app with more modern technologies (**NextJS 13**, **Tailwind**, etc.)

## Goals 
The project is currently in very early stages, but I'm hoping for it to evolve into a SaaS platform for Finnish learners.
