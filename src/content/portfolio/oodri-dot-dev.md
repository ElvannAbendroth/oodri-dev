As much as I enjoy being actively involved in the design process of projects I work on, sometimes, the best solution is the one that gets you there the quickest.  This portfolio is my project using Astro, which wasn't a big leap for me after working with NextJS.  The reason I decided to build this website with a new framework rather than the one I had been working with for a while is because although NextJS can do all of those things, a more lightweight framework with a large collection of starter templates & themes to start with was going to save me a lot of time on the setup.
