## Project Overview
This portfolio website is a static markdown site created using Astro 3.0. It's my first project with Astro. To begin, I used the "Astroship" theme as a starting point and customized its design and layouts to suit the project's needs.

## Development Experience

Developing this site was a quick and enjoyable process. Despite having no prior experience with Astro, I had a deployable version ready in just two days. I chose Astro over Jekyll due to its Node.js foundation and seamless compatibility with React, a technology I'm familiar with.

I opted for Astro over Next.js for two reasons. First, I was curious about Astro's capabilities. Second, it proved to be more efficient. Astro's lightweight structure and extensive collection of starter templates and themes saved a lot of development time compared to Next.js.

## Future Plans

I'm looking forward to using Astro for future projects, building on the experience gained from this one.
