## About this Project

I've used Shopify in order to build an e-commerce store for my artist brand.  Although this project wasn't very heavily reliant on code, I got to learn the basics of the **Liquid template synthax**, and setup customizations for the website.

for this project, I needed a platform that could easily integrate with popular **print-on-demand** services, as I did not want to manage the **warehousing** of my products.  I also wanted more **flexibility** with the designs and a **low-risk** option for selling merchandise.  The rest of the store was going to be pretty simple as the rest of my products are mostly Digital Music downloads.

Besides product management, one of the most important aspects of this project for me was being able to integrate my store to my **Email Service Provider**, Mailerlite, so that I could keep track of the sales coming from **email marketing**.

This project was pretty simple and straight-forward, and frankly not extremely tech-intensive, nonetheless I believe sometimes the most simple route is the best.  Using a pre-built solution for this was the best option for me as I needed to put up something quick and reliable that did not require a lot of customization.
